        T.Ractor: EveryDayLifePoetry. The Book of Beginnings The project
        “T.Ractor: EveryDayLifePoetry. The Book of Beginnings” is an attempt to
        create contemporary poetry in a space that connects man and machine. Set
        at the point of their direct interaction, it explores the possibility of
        creating poetic content in communication with the machine, as well as
        re-examining the limits of that communication. This project arose from
        the desire to find a new poeticity of the given moment in the torrent of
        words and content typical for the contemporary everyday life, as well as
        re-examine its sustainability and the need to create new poetic content.
        We are surrounded by an endless amount of banal words, which, following
        the rapid development of technology and the need for rapid
        communication, often change their own shape, changing the spoken
        language in the process as well. As these processes often do not
        guarantee reciprocity in the field of communication and understanding,
        the question of the need for a more careful use of language and the
        creation of new content arises. Modern lifestyle leads us to look for
        effective solutions and detect successful patterns of behavior and
        communication. Both consciously and unconsciously, we turn into machines
        that almost automatically perform actions necessary for existence
        limited by the necessities dictated by everyday life. At the same time,
        machines are becoming an integral part of life that can no longer be
        imagined without the contribution of artificial intelligence. By
        involving them in the process of transforming the language of everyday
        life into poetry, this project aims to stimulate thinking about a future
        in which cohabitation between humans and machines rises above the level
        of mere existence. The question is whether such a future will give us
        back, improve, or bring us some new kind of humanity. Author: Zorica
